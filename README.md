This is an application of every algorithm in the slide puzzle, so you have to run "python slidePuzzle.py"


I you want to modify the start positions as well as the target you have to modify
the lines 74 and 78 in the "slidePuzzle.py" file

This code is only focused on Search Algorithms in Artificial Intelligence
